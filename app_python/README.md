In this part, I'm using python/flask as a framework, doing a simple webserver to show the current time in Moscow. The time is updated with a page refreshing.
here we have the following:
* app.py: the python file contain a simple function to get the time, and render the page
* requirements: it contains the important libraries which we need to download them
* template: a simple HTML file, just to make the page clear

To excute the program you need to go to the  /app directory and run the following from the terminal:

```
python3 -m venv venv
